# Environment Setup & Installation

Download and install the following repository by the Figment team to setup your polygon development environment!

The dApp example uses several libraries that will help you develop, but make sure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and [Yarn ](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)installed already. Use any of your favorite code editors with [Solidity support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity). [Truffle ](https://trufflesuite.com)or [Hardhat (recommended) ](https://hardhat.org)would also be good to use in any of your new dApp projects as they provide local blockchain development environments.

Something more advanced (if you want to take your dApps to production) is installing [Python ](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)and [Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/tree/master/program-analysis/echidna#installation). These will help unit-test your smart contracts, making them just a bit more secure.
