# Midterm Assignment #1

**Assignment:**&#x20;

Write a basic dapp that lets a user POST to the Polygon blockchain and GET from the Polygon blockchain using a simple front-end interface.

Possibilities include retrieving all past transactions for a user address (GET) and submitting a payment using text field and button (POST). Upload your submission to github, then tweet your github link to the [Polygon Developer's](https://twitter.com/0xPolygonDevs) handle with the hashtag #midterm\_assignment1.&#x20;

âœ… You'll receive the **Developer NFT** badge after completing this.
