# Midterm Assignment #1

Assignment:&#x20;

Write a basic dapp that lets a user POST to the polygon blockchain and GET from the polygon blockchain using a simple front-end interface. Possibilities include retrieving all past transactions for a user address (GET) and submitting a payment using text field and button (POST). Upload your submission to github, then tweet your github link to the polygon devs with the hashtag #midterm\_assignment1. You'll receive a developer NFT badge.&#x20;
