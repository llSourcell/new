# Final Asssignment

Assignment:&#x20;

Submit a full stack social media dapp as your final assignment. The dapp lets a user post and receive images to an anonymous network of contributors. There will be a feed of all images. No need to add extra functionality like likes and comments, just basic push-pull data submission. Use ethereum to point to images and store them on IPFS. Use polygon as an L2 for this.&#x20;

Tweet your github link to the polygon devs twitter account for a shoutout.\
\
âœ… You'll receive the **Wizard NFT** badge after completing this.
