# Dapp Starter Kit

Congratulations on setting up your developer environment! ðŸ”¥

To earn your first badge, download and install this repository to use as a boilerplate to build any kind of dapp you can imagine! This contains all the HTML/CSS/Javascript code you need to start, as well as initial solidity contracts for smart contract development.&#x20;

Make a small change to the dapp, by modifying the index.html page to print 'hello world' to the browser, then submit your dapp to use via the following typeform page to receive your first NFT badge!&#x20;
