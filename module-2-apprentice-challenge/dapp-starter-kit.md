# Dapp Starter Kit

Congratulations on setting up your developer environment. To earn your first badge, download and install this repository to use as a boilerplate to build any kind of dapp you can imagine! This contains all the HTML/CSS/Javascript code you need to start, as well as initial solidity contracts for smart contract development. Make a small change to the dapp, either adding an HTML page that prints 'hello world' or adding a simple smart contract, then tweet your dapp to 0xpolygondevs on twitter to receive your first NFT badge:&#x20;
