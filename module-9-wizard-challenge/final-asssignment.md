# Final Asssignment

Assignment:&#x20;

Submit a full stack social media dapp as your final assignment. The dapp lets a user post and receive images to an anonymous network of contributors. There will be a feed of all images. No need to add extra functionality like likes and comments, just basic push-pull data submission. Use ethereum to point to images and store them on IPFS. Use polygon as an L2 for this. Tweet your github link to the polygon devs twitter account for a shoutout and NFT badge.
