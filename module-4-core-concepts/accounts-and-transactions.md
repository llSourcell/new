# Accounts & Transactions

Accounts and transactions on Polygon function exactly the same as they do on mainnet Ethereum, except with lower gas fees and faster finality while maintaining the same security standards.

In order to start developing, you will need an account with some testnet tokens. Please read [**network**](network.md) to get Metamask connected to the Polygon & Mumbai RPCs, and use the **** [**Polygon faucet**](https://faucet.polygon.technology) **** to get your first testnet tokens or use [**The Ethereum Bridge**](the-ethereum-bridge.md) to bridge mainnet tokens over.&#x20;
