# Superfluid

_Superfluid_ is a new token standard, with the power to describe cashflows, and execute them automatically on chain over time in a non-interactive way. It allows developers to handles subscriptions, salaries, rewards and any composable stream of value, with continuous settlement and per-second netting for extreme capital efficiency. This repo contains a simple dashboard for Superfluid payment flows using React, Web3.js, and the Superfluid JS SDK. Download, build, and run it locally so that you can explore the source code:
