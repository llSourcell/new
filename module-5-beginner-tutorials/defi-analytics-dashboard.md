# DeFi Analytics Dashboard

Moonstream is a sample Defi Analytics dashboard which helps anyone participate in decentralized finance. From the most sophisticated flash arbitrageurs to people looking for yield from currency that would otherwise lie dormant in their exchange accounts.

Moonstream users can subscribe to events from any blockchain - from the activity of specific accounts or smart contracts to updates about general market movements. This information comes from the blockchains themselves, from their mempools/transaction pools, and from centralized exchanges, social media, and the news. This forms a stream of information tailored to their specific needs. Build this repository on your local machine and explore the source code to understand how it works better:&#x20;
