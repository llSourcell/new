# Token Transfer

In this tutorial, we will go through the process of transferring an ERC-20 custom token to the Polygon (Matic) chain, using the Polygon PoS SDK.\
We will use the **Ethereum Goerli** testnet and **Polygon Mumbai** testnet, and a custom ERC-20 token that has been deployed and had its source code verified on Etherscan. There is [a step by step guide](https://github.com/mlibre/blockchain/tree/master/Ethereum/ERC20) written by the author of this tutorial.\
The Polygon Proof of Stake (PoS) Bridge is a mechanism and set of contracts on both Ethereum and Polygon that will help us in moving assets between the **root** chain and **child** chain.\
In contrast with the [Plasma Bridge](https://docs.matic.network/docs/develop/ethereum-matic/plasma/getting-started/), the Polygon PoS bridge is much faster and makes it a better option for dApps that are looking for faster withdrawals.
