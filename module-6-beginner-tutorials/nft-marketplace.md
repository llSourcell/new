# NFT Marketplace

In this tutorial we are going to learn how to build an NFT Marketplace smart contract. Our marketplace smart contract will enable its users to list their NFT on the contract by paying a small fee. This NFT marketplace is a medium where people can buy and sell their NFTs. We will learn about writing unit tests and how to deploy our contract to the Polygon Mumbai testnet using HardHat, as well as how to verify the contract source code on Polygonscan so it is publicly available.
