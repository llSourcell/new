# ETL Pipeline

An _ETL pipeline_ is the set of processes used to move data from a source or multiple sources into a database such as a data warehouse. Polygon ETL allows you to setup an ETL pipeline in Google Cloud Platform for ingesting Polygon blockchain data into BigQuery and Pub/Sub. It comes with [CLI tools](https://github.com/blockchain-etl/polygon-etl/blob/main/cli) for exporting Polygon data into convenient formats like CSVs and relational databases. Build and run this source code to better understand how it works:
