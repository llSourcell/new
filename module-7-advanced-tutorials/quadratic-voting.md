# Quadratic Voting

In this tutorial, we will be learning how to create a quadratic voting app with collaboratively managed ranked lists. This is a fairly complex application and a good exercise in serious dApp development. We're going to write a smart contract in Solidity and a front-end in Vue.js, then deploy our dApp on the Polygon testnet.Here's a preview of what we will be building:
