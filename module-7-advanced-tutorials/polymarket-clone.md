# Polymarket Clone

In this tutorial, we will learn how to create a [Polymarket](https://polymarket.com) clone. Polymarket is a decentralized information market, harnessing the power of free markets to demystify the real-world events that matter most.We will create a full-stack dApp with an admin panel where events/markets are created, and a UI where users can predict the outcome on the website. In this tutorial we will create two smart contracts, one for the ERC20 tokens used on our website to delegate an amount to a specific event, and another contract for Polymarket itself.This is what the dApp we will be creating looks like:
