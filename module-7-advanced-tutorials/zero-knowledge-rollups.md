# Zero Knowledge Rollups

A zero-knowledge rollup is **a Layer 2 blockchain solution that performs computations and storage off-chain** while funds are held in a smart contract. The solution came in the form of Layer 2 blockchains and additional developments like zero-knowledge rollups. Hermez implements these solutions and Polygon acquired them. HermezJS is an open-source SDK to interact with Hermez Rollup network. It can be downloaded as an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hermeznetwork/hermezjs), or via [github](https://github.com/hermeznetwork/hermezjs). In this tutorial we will walk through the process of using the SDK to use Zero Knowledge Rollups for simple transaction use cases.
